# Parallel Computing for Machine Learning

## Problem description:
### Here, we hope to develop a general way of programming Machine Learning on multi-core, in order to take advantage of the massive computing power of modern computers and thus speed the learning process.

## Parallel and computing techniques to be used:
### We will use Map-Reduce technique and possibly Apache Spark framework.


## Expected result:
### we expect to parallelize a large class of machine learning algorithms on multicore processors, and find how much these learning algorithms can be improved in terms of running time.
