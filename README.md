# Parallel Computing for Machine Learning
## Machine learning, in general, is a statiscal approach to identify latent governing patterns in large datasets and make new discoveries with the uncovered pattern. Nowadays, the Internet produces enormous amounts of data every second, and processing such data with machine learning in real time is beyond the capibility of any single CPU.

# How:
### Here, we hope to develop a general way of programming Machine Learning on multi-core, in order to take advantage of the massive computing power of modern computers and thus speed the learning process.

## Parallel computing techniques to be used:
### We will use Map-Reduce technique and possibly Apache Spark framework.

## Expected result:
### we expect to parallelize a large class of machine learning algorithms on multicore processors, and find how much these learning algorithms can be improved in terms of running time.

## How it should work
